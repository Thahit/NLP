# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Naive Bayes
The hypothesis is that just like in different sentiments, Fake tweets use different words than the Tweets about real disasters. With the help of a Naive Bayes I try to get the possibilities of these words and use them to predict the test data.

The result was better than expected, it outperformed more than 50% of the participants.
