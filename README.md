# NLP
Reiterating what I have learned in the NLP cousera Specialization, testing the methods in other environments...


A lot of the assignments... like the ones about auto-completion don't offer much, because I would just do exactly the same things as in the assignments, not apply it to other scenarios and wont learn new things, which is why I wont do them here again.
