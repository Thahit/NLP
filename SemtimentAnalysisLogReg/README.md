# sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews-with-logistic

The method of making a vector according to how many times a word in the target text has also been used in other  texts of a certain sentiment does not seem to be working very well, when there is more than two sentiments (positive / negative), which was to be expected. I do not think that a sentence with sentiment 2 uses many different words than one with sentiment 3 (Sentiments:  0-4). The confirmation of this assumption is still something usefull to know.
